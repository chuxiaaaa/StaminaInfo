# StaminaInfo



This mod is only found at https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/jkqt/StaminaInfo/ - Do NOT download it from anywhere else!

Quantify each status as a number within their respective bars (at their center).

Note: This mod uses bar width to calculate (instead of pulling from character data).

- Works for:
  - Stamina Bar
  - Extra Stamina Bar
  - Affliction Bars

- Configurable:
  - Font Size
  - Outline Width
  - Round Stamina & Extra Stamina
  - Round Afflictions

The number will be cut off or removed if it cannot fit inside the bar.
